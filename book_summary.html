<h2>REASON FOR THE TITLE:</h2>
<P>Reason for the Title "Invisible Lines":
    I chose Invisible Lines because it captures the hidden barriers and divisions that shaped Trevor Noah’s life under the apartheid rule and how he was going through challenges no one else knew about or understood even his own mother. Although the laws  in south Africa during trhe time of segregation were enforced by the government and in schools he went to, the real impact of the laws was felt in the unspoken and invisible rules that dictated where he could go like the class he'd be put in, who they could love how he was not allowed to meet at a close range with his father or else thy'd be arrested, and how he could live and even the friends he interacted with. These challenges  weren't always visible — they existed in people’s minds around the time where the black people felt he was too white and the white people felt he was too black for them, in fears of being arrested or killed, and in societal structures that separated his races, communities, and even families.
    The born a crime also narrates Noah's struggles alone and the battles he faced without the knowledge of his mother and even his close friends.He had to witness the aufull marriage that his mom and Abel had.
    Throughout Born a Crime, Trevor navigates these invisible challenges (lines) daily, constantly adapting to survive to his environment. The title reflects both the literal and metaphorical barriers that, while unseen, powerfully controlled his existence.</P> </div>

    The quote, "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage,'" captures a contradiction that still exists in many relationships today. It puts a narrow gap and distingtion  between admiration and control —most men even in today's society  want the strength and independence of their partner, but also want to put them under control and limit them.
In oor modern society today, gender roles have evolved rapidly. Women are increasingly encouraged to be independent, career-driven, outspoken, and ambitious. However, some traditional expectations around relationships continue to exist, where men (or even society at large) still expect women to be okay with control, accommodating, and to prioritize the relationship or family over their personal ambitions. Abel’s mindset of wanting a free woman only to try and cage her reflects an ongoing societal struggle especially in Patriachy the desire for partnership with strong individuals, coupled with discomfort when those individuals act independently.
For example, many successful women today still report facing backlash in dating. Some are told they are "too intimidating" or "too ambitious." There are unspoken pressures for women to "dim their light" to make a man feel more comfortable or to conform to more traditional roles once they enter serious relationships or marriage. This dynamic isn't limited to romantic relationships either — it echoes in workplaces and families, where women may be celebrated for their achievements but expected to compromise them once they take on roles like wife or mother.
 In the book we see how Patricia was going through much trouble taking care of her drunkard husband and how he used to physically and emotionally abuse her just to put her under control.Patricia was strong and didnt care about what society thought of her as it is shown by her moving houses to protect her peace.Abel ws threatened by the independence of Patricia in finding a job and a livelihood. 
With that said, there is also a growing movement amongst today's women  that challenges these outdated norms. This serves as an inspiration to me and other girls in the society to let no one deam our light.We should shine not because we are any different but because we are all humans and we got what it takes.
